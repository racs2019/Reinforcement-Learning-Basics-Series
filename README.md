# Reinforcement Learning Basics Series

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce and demonstrate fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning (RL). The projects include examples of popular RL algorithms applied to simple yet illustrative environments.

## Notebooks

1. **Actor_Critic_Blackjack.ipynb**  
   Implements an Actor-Critic algorithm to solve the Blackjack game, showcasing policy and value function updates in a continuous improvement loop.

2. **Deep_Q_Learning_Maze.ipynb**  
   Explores the Deep Q-Learning algorithm applied to a maze-solving task, demonstrating how neural networks can approximate Q-values for decision-making.

3. **Inverted_Pendulum_Deep_Q_Learning.ipynb**  
   Applies Deep Q-Learning to control an inverted pendulum, a classic problem in RL involving balancing a pole on a moving cart.

4. **Q_Learning_Maze.ipynb**  
   Demonstrates the tabular Q-Learning algorithm for solving a maze, emphasizing the use of a Q-table to store and update state-action values.
